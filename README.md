# AI-Smart-Waste-Management
This repository contains a research paper developed as part of a group project for the Artificial Intelligence module in the MSc program. The objective of this paper is to explore current systems and methodologies in waste management and to propose an enhanced smart waste management system utilizing AI.

Project Overview
AI can be effectively integrated into various stages of waste management to optimize efficiency and sustainability. For this project, we narrowed our research focus to the core processes of:

->Trash Collection: Methods to streamline and optimize collection routes.
->Waste Segregation: Use of AI for accurate sorting of recyclables and waste.
->Waste Disposal: AI-driven disposal techniques to minimize environmental impact.

The proposed system architecture encompasses three key processes of Waste Collection, Waste Segregation and Waste Disposal. Each component in the architecture is designed to leverage AI for improving waste management outcomes.

In the final section of our paper, we analyze the proposed system, highlighting its benefits, limitations, and potential areas for future development. This includes prospective improvements in AI-based technologies for smarter, more sustainable waste management practices.
